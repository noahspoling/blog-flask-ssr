# blog-flask-ssr

This the the repository for my personal blog to eventually publish my various papers. It uses an interesting technology stack including:

* ArrowJS:
  
  A reactive library with no build tools. Some of the benefits of component based rendering for organization while loading fast with cached js files. 
* HTMX:

  For Ajax rquests and learning a new library
* Flask:

  For learning a new static file web server that can make use of python's vast module library for data science in the future

This project supports a user system for multiple authors and comments. The contact me form can be used in the eventual implementation of the admin dashboard to control the role users have. 

TODO:
* Implement a series

Will require a custom search select option input for large number of post series.
